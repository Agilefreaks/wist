# About

BSLint started in August 2017 as a way to bring the robust linting capabilities found in other languages to
Roku developers. It is somewhat of a spiritual sibling to [ESLint](https://eslint.org). While not a direct
fork, BSLint shares a lot of common themes, principles, and in some cases, code with ESLint. Our hope
is to to build a strong community of Roku developers that is well equipped to make awesome experiences
for Roku devices.
