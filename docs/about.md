# About

## History

Wist was created at [WillowTree](https://willowtreeapps.com/careers), the mobile product agency.

It started in August 2017 as a way to bring the robust linting capabilities of other languages to the larger community of BrightScript developers.


## Philosophy

While not a direct fork, Wist shares themes, principles, and in some cases, code, with [ESLint](https://eslint.org).

Our hope is to strengthen and equip the community of BrightScript developers to make awesome experiences for Roku devices.
