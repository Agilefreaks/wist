# About

Wisteria started in August 2017 as a way to bring the robust linting capabilities found in other languages to Roku developers. It is somewhat of a spiritual sibling to [ESLint](https://eslint.org).

While not a direct fork, Wisteria shares a lot of common themes, principles, and in some cases, code with [ESLint](https://eslint.org).

Our hope is to to build a strong community of Roku developers that is well equipped to make awesome experiences for Roku devices.
